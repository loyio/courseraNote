#### Handling the keyboard

Hack RAM 24576

To check which key is currently pressed:

- Read the content of RAM[23576]
- If the register contains 0, no key is pressed
- Otherwise, the register contains the scan code of the currently pressed key





#### End note: compilation

High level code compiler to Machine language



Low level programming is ...

- Low level
- Profound
- Subtle
- Intellectually challenging
