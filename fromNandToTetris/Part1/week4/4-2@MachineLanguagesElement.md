## Machine Languages: Element

### Machine Language

- Specification of the Hardware/Software Interface
- Usually in close correspondence to actual Hardware Architecture
- Cost-Performance Tradeoff





### Machine Operations

- Usually correspond to what's implemented in Hardware
- Differences between machine languages





### Memory Hierarchy

- Accessing a memory location is expensive
- Solution: Memory Hierarchy





### Registers

- CPUS usually contain a few, easily accessed, "registers"
- Their number and functions are a central part of the machine language
- Data Registers
- Address Registers



### Addressing Modes

- Register
- Direct
- Indirect
- Immediate



### Input / Output

- Many types of Input and Output Devices
- CPU needs some kind of protocol to talk to each of them
- One general method of interaction uses "memory mapping "



### Flow Control

- Usually the CPU executes machine instructions in sequence

- Sometime we need to "jump" unconditionally to another location, s we can loop
- Sometime we need to jump only if some condition is met
