## Proxy Services



A proxy service is a server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service. Proxies sit between clients and other servers, providing some additional benefit, anonymity, security, content filtering, increased performance, a couple other things. If any part of this sounds familiar, that's good. We've already covered some specific examples of proxies, like gateway routers. You don't hear them referred to this way, but a gateway definitely meets the definition of what a proxy is and how it works. The concept of a proxy is just that, a concept or an abstraction. It doesn't refer to any specific implementation. Proxies exist at almost every layer of our networking model. There are dozens and dozens of examples of proxies you might run into during your career, but we'll cover just a few of the most common ones here. Most often, you'll hear the term, proxy, used to refer to web proxies. As you might guess, these are proxies specifically built for web traffic. A web proxy can serve lots of purposes. Many years ago, when most Internet connections were much slower than they are today, lots of organizations used web proxies for increased performance. Using a web proxy, an organization would direct all web traffic through it, allowing the proxy server itself to actually retrieve the webpage data from the Internet. It would then cache this data. This way, if someone else requested the same webpage, it could just return the cached data instead of having to retrieve the fresh copy every time. This kind of proxy is pretty old and you wont often find them in use today, why? Well, for one thing, most organizations now have connections fast enough that caching individual webpages doesn't provide much benefit. Also, the Web has become much more dynamic. Going to www.twitter.com is going to look different to every person with their own Twitter account, so caching this data wouldn't do much good. A more common use of a web proxy today might be to prevent someone from accessing sites, like Twitter, entirely. A company might decide that accessing Twitter during work hours reduces productivity. By using a web proxy, they can direct all web traffic to it, allow the proxy to inspect what data is being requested, and then allow or deny this request, depending on what site is being accessed. Another example of a proxy is a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is a service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it. A good example of this is how lots of popular websites are architected today. Very popular websites, like Twitter, receive so much traffic that there's no way a single web server could possibly handle all of it. A website that popular might need many, many web servers in order to keep up with processing all incoming requests. A reverse proxy, in this situation, could act as a single front-end for many web servers living behind it. From the clients' perspective, it looks like they're all connected to the same server. But behind the scenes, this reverse proxy server is actually distributing these incoming requests to lots of different physical servers. Much like the concept of DNS Round Robin, this is a form of load balancing. Another way that reverse proxies are commonly used by popular websites is to deal with decryption. More than half of all traffic on the Web is now encrypted, and encrypting and decrypting data is a process that can take a lot of processing power. You'll learn a lot more about encryption and how it works in another course in this program. Reverse proxies are now implemented in order to use hardware built specifically for cryptography, to perform the enryption and decryption work. So that the web servers are free to just serve content. Proxies come in many other flavors, way too many for us to cover them all here. But the most important takeaway is that proxies are any server that act as a intermediary between a client and another server. Good job, we covered a lot. Take a break for a bit before you move on to the quiz and project we've cooked up for you. Once you're done with these, take another break, and then meet me back here for the next module where we'll cover the history of Internet connections.



代理服务是代表客户端以 访问其他服务的服务器。 代理位于客户端和 其他服务器之间，提供了一些额外的好处，匿名性， 安全性，内容过滤，提高性能，以及其他几件事情。 如果其中任何一部分听起来很熟悉，那是很好的。 我们已经介绍了一些代理的具体示例，例如网关路由器。 你没有听到他们这样引用，但 网关绝对符合代理的定义及其工作原理。 代理的概念就是这样，概念或抽象。 它没有指任何特定的实现。 我们网络模型的几乎每一层都存在代理。 您在 职业生涯中可能会遇到几十个代理的例子，但我们将在这里介绍几个最常见的例子。大多数情况下，您会听到用于指 Web 代理的术语 “代理”。 正 如您可能猜到的那样，这些代理是专门为 Web 流量构建的。 Web 代理可以服务于很多用途。 许多年前，当大多数互联网连接速度比 现在慢得多时，许多组织都使用 Web 代理来提高性能。 使用 Web 代理， 一个组织将引导所有网络流量通过它，从而使代理 服务器本身能够实际从 Internet 检索网页数据。 然后它会缓存这些数据。 这样，如果其他人请求相同的网页，它可能只返回 缓存的数据，而不必每次都检索新的副本。这种代理是相当老的，你不会经常发现它们今天在使用，为什么？那么，首先，大多数组织现在的连接速度足够快，以至于缓存单个网页并不会带来太大的好处。 此外，网络变得更加动态。 对 于每个拥有 自己 Twitter 帐户的人来说，访问 www.twitter.com 会看起来不一样，所以缓存这些数据并不会有什么好处。 如今，Web 代理的一个更常见的用法 可能是完全阻止某人访问网站，如 Twitter。 公司可能会决定在工作时间访问 Twitter 会 降低工作效率。 通过使用 Web 代理，他们可以将所有 Web 流量定向到它， 允许代理检查请求的数据，然后允许或 拒绝此请求，具体取决于访问的站点。 代理的另一个示例是反向代理。 反向代理是一种服务， 它可能看起来是外部客户端的单个服务器，但实际上代表了许多服务器。 这方面的一个很好的例子就是如何设计了许多流行网站。 非常受欢迎的网站，如 Twitter，获得了如此多的流量，以至于 单个 Web 服务器无法处理所有这些。 一个受欢迎的网站可能需要 许多多 Web 服务器才能跟上处理所有传入请求的步伐。在这种情况下，反向代理可以充当 许多生活在其后面的 Web 服务器的单一前端。 从客户的角度来看， 它看起来他们都连接到同一台服务器。 但是在幕后，这个反向代理服务器实际上是 将这些传入请求分发到许多不同的物理服务器。 与 DNS 轮询的概念非常相似，这是一种负载平衡的形式。流行网站通常使用反向代理的另一种方 法是处理解密问题。 Web 上的所有流量中有一半以上现在已加密，加密和 解密数据是一个需要大量处理能力的过程。在本课程的另一门课程中，您将了解更多关于加密及其工作原理的信息。现在实现了反向代理 ，以便使用专门为加密构建的硬件来执行保留和解密工作。 这样，Web 服务器就可以自由地提供内容。代理有许多其他口味，太多了，我们无法在这里覆盖它们。 但最重要的是，代理是任何在 客户端和另一台服务器之间充当中介的服务器。 干得 好，我们覆盖了很多。 请先休息一下，然后再进入 我们为您准备的测验和项目。 一 旦你完成了这些，再休息一下，然后在这里与我见 面，参加下一个模块，我们将介绍互联网连接的历史。
