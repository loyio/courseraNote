## Wireless Channels



The concept of channels is one of the most important things to understand about wireless networking. Channels are individual, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network. Channels are super important because they help address a very old networking concern, collision domains. You might remember that a collision domain is any one network segment where one computer can interrupt another. Communications that overlap each other can't be properly understood by the receiving end. So when two or more transmissions occur at the same time, also called a collision, all devices in question have to stop their transmissions. They wait a random amount of time and try again when things quiet down. This really slows things down. The problem caused by collision domains has been mostly reduced on wired networks through devices called switches. Switches remember which computers live on which physical interfaces. So traffic is only sent to the node It's intended for. Wireless networking doesn't have cables, so there aren't physical interfaces for a wireless device to connect to. That means, we can have something that works like a wireless switch. Wireless devices are doomed to talk over each other. Channels help fix this problem to a certain extent. When we were talking about the concept the frequency bands, we mentioned that FM radio in North America operates between 80 megahertz and 108 megahertz. But when we discuss the frequency bands we use by Wi-Fi, we just mentioned 2.4 Gigahertz and five Gigahertz. This is because that's really just shorthand for where these frequency bands actually begin. For wireless networks that operate on a 2.4 Gigahertz band, what we really mean is that they operate on roughly the band from 2.4 Gigahertz to 2.5 Gigahertz. Between these two frequencies are a number of channels, each with a width of a certain megahertz. Since different countries and regions have different regulatory committees for what radio frequencies might be used for what, exactly how many channels are available for use depends on where in the world you are. For example, dealing with an 802.11b network, channel one operates at 2412 megahertz, but since the channel width is 22 megahertz, the signal really lives on the frequencies between 2401 megahertz and 2423 megahertz. This is because radio waves are imprecise things. So, you need some buffer around what exact frequencies a transmission might actually arrive on. Some channels overlap but some are far enough apart so they won't interfere with each other at all. Let's look again at 802.11b network running on a 2.4 Gigahertz band, because it's really the simplest and the concepts translate to all other 802.11 specifications. With a channel width of 22 megahertz, channel one with its midpoint at 2412 megahertz, is always completely isolated from channel six with its midpoint at 2437 megahertz. For an 802.11b network, this means that channels one and six and 11 are the only ones that never overlap at all. That's not all that matters, though. Today, most wireless networking equipment is built to auto sense what channels are most congested. Some access points will only perform this analysis when they start up, others will dynamically change their channel as needed. Between those two scenarios and manually specified channels, you can still run into situations where you experience heavy channel congestion. This is especially true in dense urban areas with lots of wireless networks in close proximity. So, why is this important in the world of I.T. support? Well, understanding how these channels overlap for all of the 802.11 specifications is a way you can help troubleshoot bad wireless connectivity problems or slowdowns in the network. You want to avoid collision domains wherever you can. I should call out that it's not important to memorize all of the individual numbers we've talked about. The point is to understand how collision domains are a necessary problem with all wireless networks, and how you can use your knowledge in this space to optimize wireless network deployments. You want to make sure that both your own access points and those of neighboring businesses overlap channels as little as possible.



通道的概念是 关于无线网络的最重要的事情之一。通道是无线网络使用的整个频段中的单独、较小的部分。 渠道非常重要，因为它们有助于解决 一个非常老的网络问题，即冲突域。 您可能记得，冲突域是 一台计算机可以中断另一台计算机的任何一个网段。 接收端无法正确理解彼此重叠的通信。 因此，当两个或更多的传输同时发生（ 也称为碰撞）时， 所有相关设备都必须停止其传输。 他们等待随机量的时间，然后再试一次，当事情安静下来。 这真的减慢了事情。 冲突域引起的问题主要 通过称为交换机的设备在有线网络上得到减少。 交换机记住哪些计算机位于哪些物理接口上。 所以流量只发送到节点它的目的。 无线网络没有电缆， 因此没有可供无线设备连接的物理接口。 这意味着，我们可以拥有像无线交换机一样工作的东西。 无线设备注定要相互交谈。 渠道有助于在一定程度上修复此问题。 当我们谈论频带的概念时， 我们提到，在北美的 FM 无线电工作在 80 兆赫和 108 兆赫之间。 但是，当我们讨论 Wi-Fi 使用的频段时， 我们刚刚提到 2.4 千兆赫和 5 千兆赫。 这是因为这实际上只是 这些频段实际开始的速记。 对于使用 2.4 千兆赫频段运行的无线网络， 我们真正的意思是它们的工作 频段大致为 2.4 千兆赫到 2.5 千兆赫的频段。 这两个频率之间是一些通道， 每个具有一定兆赫兹的宽度。 由于不同的国家和地区设立了 不同的监管委员会，可用于哪 些无线电频率，因此可供使用的确切频道数量取决于您在世界的哪个位置。 例如，处理 802.11b 网络 时，通道一以 2412 兆赫兹运行， 但由于信道宽度为 22 兆赫兹， 信号实际上存在于 2401 兆赫兹和 2423 兆赫兹之间的频率上。 这是因为无线电波是不精确的东西。 所以，你需要一些 关于传输实际到达的确切频率的缓冲区。有些通道重叠，但有些相距足够远，因此它们根本不会相互干扰。 让我们再次看看在 2.4 千兆赫频段上运行的 802.11b 网络， 因为它确实是最简单的，概念 转化为所有其他 802.11 规范。 通道宽度为 22 兆赫， 其中点为 2412 兆赫的通道一 总是与通道 6 完全隔离，其中点为 2437 兆赫兹。 对于 802.11b 网络， 这意味着通道 1、6 和 11 是唯一一个根本不重叠的网络。 不 过，这并不是所有重要的。 如今，大多数无线网络设备都是 为了自动检测哪些通道最拥挤。 某些接入点仅在启动时执行此分析， 其他接入点将根据需要动态更改其通道。在这两种情况和手动指定的通道之间，您仍然可能会遇到严重的通道拥塞的情况。 这在 密集的城市地区尤其如此，有大量的无线网络接近。 那么，为什么这在 IT 支持领域很重要呢？ 那么，了解这些通道如何与所有 802.11 规范相互重叠，您可以帮助解决 网络中的不良无线连接问题或减速问题。 您希望尽可能避免冲突域。 我应该指出， 记住我们谈到的所有个别数字并不重要。 关键在于了解冲突域如何成为 所有无线网络的必要问题， 以及如何利用您在 此领域的知识优化无线网络部署。 您希望确保您自己的接入点和 邻近企业的接入点尽可能少地重叠渠道。
