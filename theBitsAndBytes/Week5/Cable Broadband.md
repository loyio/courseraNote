## Cable Broadband

The history of both the telephone and computer networking tells a story that started with all communications being wired. But the recent trend is moving towards more and more of this traffic becoming wireless. The history of television follows the opposite path. Originally, all television broadcasts were wireless transmissions sent out by giant television towers and received by smaller antennas in people's homes. This meant you had to be within range of one of these television towers to watch TV, just like you have to be within range of a cell phone tower to use your cellphone today. Starting in the late 1940s in the United States, the first cable television technologies were developed. At the time, they mainly wanted to provide television access to remote towns and rural homes that were out of range of capabilities of television towers at the time. Cable television continued to expand slowly over the decades, but in 1984, The Cable Communications Policy Act was passed. This deregulated the cable television business in the United States and caused a massive boom in growth and adoption. Other countries all over the globe soon followed. By the early 1990s, cable television infrastructure in the United States was about the size of the public telephone system. Not too long after that, cable providers started trying to figure out if they could join in on the massive spike in Internet growth that was happening at the same time. Much like how DSL was developed, cable companies quickly realized that the coaxial cables generally used by cable television delivery into a person's home were capable of transmitting much more data than what was required for TV viewing. By using frequencies that don't interfere with television broadcast, cable-based Internet access technologies were able to deliver high speed Internet access across these same cables. This is the technology that we refer to when we say cable broadband. One of the main differences in how cable Internet access works when compared to other broadband solutions is that cable is generally what's known as a shared bandwidth technology. With technologies like DSL or even dial up, the connection from your home or business goes directly to what's known as a Central Office or CO. A long time ago, the COs were actually offices staffed with telephone operators who used a switchboard to manually connect the caller with the callee. As technology improved, the COs became smaller pieces of automated hardware that handled these functions for the telephone companies, but the name stayed the same. Technologies that connect directly to a CO can guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth available over that connection since it's point to point. On the flip side of this, are cable Internet technologies, which employ a shared bandwidth model. With this model in place, many users share a certain amount of bandwidth until the transmissions reach the ISP's core network. This could be anywhere from a single city block to entire subdivisions in the suburbs. It just depends on how that area was originally wired for cables. Today, most cable operators have tried to upgrade their networks to the point that end users might not always notice the shared bandwidth. But it's also still common to see cable Internet connections slow down during periods of heavy use. Like when lots of people in the same region are using their Internet connection at the same time. Cable Internet connections are usually managed by what's known as a cable modem. This is a device that sits at the edge of a consumer's network and connects it to the cable modem termination system, or CMTS. The CMTS is what connects lots of different cable connections to an ISP's core network.



电话和计算机网络的历史都讲述了一个故事，这个故事 始于所有通信都是有线的。 但最近的趋势是，越来越 多的这种流量变成无线网络。 电视的历史遵循相反的道路。 最初，所有的电视广播都 是由巨型电视塔发出的无线传输，人们家中较小的天线接收。 这意味着你必须在这些电视塔的范围内看电 视，就像你必须在手机塔的范围内才能 使用你的手机。 自20 世纪 40 年代末在美国开发 了第一个有线电视技术。 当时，他们主要希望向当时电视塔能力超出的偏远城镇和农村家庭提供电视接入。几十年来，有线电视继续缓慢发展，但 1984 年通 过了《有线通信政策法》。 这就取消了美国有线电视业务的管制， 引起了增长和采用的巨大繁荣。 世界各地的其他国家很快就会随之而来。到 1990 年代初, 美国的有线电视基础设施与公共电话系统的规模大致相同. 不久之后， 有线电视提供商开始试图弄清楚他们 是否可以加入互联网增长的巨大峰值。 与DSL 的开发方式非常相似，有线电视公司很快意识到， 有线电视通常使用的同轴电缆 能够传输比电 视观看所需要的更多的数据。 通过使用不干扰电视广播的频率， 基于有线的互联网接入技术 能够通过这些相同的电缆提供高速互联网接入。 这是我们提到的技术，当我们说有线宽带。 与其他宽带解决方案相比，有线互联网接入工作原理的主要区别之一 是，电缆通常是所谓的共享带宽技术。 借助 DSL 甚至拨号等技术，您的家庭或 企业可以直接连接到所谓的中央办公室或 CO。 很久以前，服务员实际上是配备电话接线员的办公室， 他们使用交换机手动连接呼叫者和被调用者。 随着技术的改进，COS 变成了为 电话公司处理这些功能的自动化硬件，但名称保持不变。 直接连接到 CO 的技术可以保证通 过该连接提供一定量的带宽，因为它是点对点。 在这个反面, 有线互联网技术, 它采用共享带宽模型. 有了这种模式，许多用户将共享一定量的带宽，直到 传输到达 ISP 的核心网络。 这可能是任何地方，从一个城市街区 到郊区的整个细分区。 这只取决于该区域最初是如何连接电缆的。 如今，大多数有线电视运营商都试图将其网络升级到最 终用户可能并不总是注意到共享带宽的程度。 但是，在 大量使用期间，有线互联网连接速度减慢仍然很常见。 就像同一地区的许多人同 时使用互联网连接一样。 有线互联网连接通常由称为电缆调制解调器管理。 这是位于消费者网络边缘的设备 ，并将其连接到电缆调制解调器终端系统或 CMTS。 CMTS 是将大量不同的电缆连接 到 ISP 的核心网络。
