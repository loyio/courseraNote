## Dial-up, Modems and Point-to-Point Protocols

As computer use grew over the course of 20th century, it became obvious that there was a big need to connect computers to each other so that they could share data. For years before Ethernet, TCP or IP were ever invented, there were computer networks made up of technologies way more primitive than the model we've been discussing. These early networking technologies mostly focused on connecting devices within close physical proximity to each other. In the late 1970s two graduate students at Duke University were trying to come up with a better way to connect computers at further distances. They wanted to share what was essentially bulletin board material, then a light bulb moment went off. They realized the basic infrastructure for this already existed, the public telephone network. The public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN is also sometimes referred to as the Plain Old Telephone Service or POTS. It was already a pretty global and powerful system by the late 1970s more than 100 years after the invention of the telephone. These Duke grad students weren't the first ones to think about using a phone line to transmit data. But they were the first do it in a way that became somewhat permanent precursor to the dial up networks to follow. The system they built is known as USENET and a form of it is still in use today. At the time, different locations, like colleges and universities, used a very primitive form of a dial-up connection to exchange a series of messages with each other. A dial-up connection uses POTS for data transfer, and gets its name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number. If you used dial up, back in the day, this noise might sound familiar to you. [NOISE] For some of us it was like nails on a chalkboard as we waited to get connected to the Internet. Transferring data across a dial-up connection is done through devices called modems. Modem stands for modulator demodulator, and they take data that computers can understand and turn them into audible wavelengths that can be transmitted over POTS. After all, the telephone system was developed to transmit voice messages or sounds from one place to another. This is conceptually similar to how line coding is used to turn ones and zeroes into modulating electrical charges across Ethernet cables. Early modems had very low baud rates. A baud rate is a measurement of how many bits could be passed across a phone line in a second. By the late 1950s, computers could generally only send each other data across a phone line at about a 110 bits per second. By the time USENET was being developed, this rate had increased to around 300 bits per second. And by the time dial-up access to the Internet became a household commodity in the early 1990s, this rate had increased to 14.4 kilobits per second. Improvements continue to be made, but widespread adoption of broadband technologies, which we'll discuss in the next lesson, replaced a lot of these improvements. Dial-up Internet connectivity is pretty rare today but it hasn't completely gone away. In some rural areas, it might be the only option still available. You might never run into a dial-up Internet connection during your IT career. But it's still important to know that for several decades this technology represented the main way computers communicated with each other over long distances. I'm just glad we don't have to choose between using the phone or using the Internet anymore. Next, let's take a deep dive into the world of broadband.



随着计算机使用在 20 世纪的增长， 很明显，计算机互相连接以便能够共享数据的需求变得十分明显。 在以太网、TCP 或 IP 被发明之前，有些计算机网络由技术组成， 比我们讨论的模型更加原始。 这些早期的网络技术主要侧重于连接 彼此紧密物理接近的设备。 在 20 世纪 70 年代末，杜克大学的两名研究生 试图找到一种更好的方法来连接远距离的计算机。 他们想分享什么本质上是公告板材料 ，然后灯泡瞬间熄灭。 他们意识到 这个基本的基础设施已经存在，公共电话网络。 公共交换电话网络或 PSTN 有 时也称为普通旧电话服务或 POTS。 它已经是一个相当全球和强大的系统，到 20 世纪 70 年代末，电话发明后 100 多年。 这些杜克研究生并不是第一个考虑使用电话线 传输数据的人。 但是，他们是第一个 以某种方式做到这一点，成为拨号网络跟随的有点永久性的前兆。 他们建造的系统被称为 USENET，它的一种形式仍在使用中。 当时，不同的地点，如 大学和大学，使用非常原始的拨号连接形式 来互相交换一系列消息。 拨号连接使用 POTS 进行数据传输，并获取其名称， 因为连接是通过实际拨打电话号码建立的。 如果你使用拨号，回到一天，这种噪音可能听起来很熟悉。 [ 噪音] 对我们中的一些人来说，它就像黑板上的钉子，当 我们等待着连接到互联网。 通 过拨号连接传输数据是通过称为 调制解调器的设备完成的。 调制解调器代表调制器解调器，它们采集计算机可以理解的数据，并将它们转换为可通过 POTS 传输的可听波长。 毕竟，电话系统的开发是为了将语音信息或声 音从一个地方传输到另一个地方。 这在概念上类似于如何使用线路编码将 1 和零转换为通过以太网电缆调制电荷。 早期的调制解调器具有非常低的波特率。 波特率是一 秒钟内通过电话线路传递多少位的测量值。 到了 20 世纪 50 年代末，计算机通常只能以每 秒 110 位的速度通过电话线相互发送数据。 在 USENET 开发时， 这一速率已经提高到每秒 300 位左右。 到 1990 年代初，互联网拨号连接成为一种家庭商品，这一比率已增加到每秒 14.4 千比特。 继续改进，但 宽带技术的广泛采用 ，我们将在下一课中讨论，取代了许多这些改进。 拨号互联网连接现在是相当罕见的，但 它并没有完全消失。 在一些农村地区，这可能是唯一可用的选择。 在 IT 职业生涯中，您可能永远不会遇到拨号互联网连接。 但重要的是要知道， 几十年来，这项技术代表了 计算机之间长距离通信的主要方式。 我只是很高兴我们不需要选择使用手机或 使用互联网了。 接下来，让我们深入了解宽带世界。
