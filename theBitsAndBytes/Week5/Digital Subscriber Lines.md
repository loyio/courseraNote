## Digital Subscriber Lines

The public telephone network was a great option for getting people connected to the Internet since it already had infrastructure everywhere. For a long time, dial-up connections were the main way that people connected to the Internet from home. But there were certain limitations with trying to transmit data as what were essentially just audio waves. As people wanted faster and faster Internet access, telephone companies began to wonder if they could use the same infrastructure but in a different way. The research showed that twisted pair copper used by modern telephone lines was capable of transmitting way more data than what was needed for voice-to-voice calls. By operating at a frequency range that didn't interfere with normal phone calls, a technology known as digital subscriber line or DSL was able to send much more data across the wire than traditional dial-up technologies. To top it all off, this allowed for normal voice phone calls and data transfer to occur at the same time on the same line. Like how dial-up uses modems, DSL technologies also use their own modems. But, more accurately, they're known as DSLAMs or Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers. Just like dial-up modems, these devices establish data connections across phone lines, but unlike dial-up connections, they're usually long-running. This means that the connection is generally established when the DSLAM is powered on and isn't torn down until the DSLAM is powered off. There are lots of different kinds of DSL available, but they all vary in a pretty minor way. For a long time, the two most common types of DSL were ADSL and SDSL. ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. ADSL connections feature different speeds for outbound and incoming data. Generally, this means faster download speeds and slower upload speeds. Home users rarely need to upload as much data as they download since home users are mostly just clients. For example, when you open a web page in a web browser, the upload or outbound data is pretty small. You're just asking for a certain web page from the web server. The download or inbound data tends to be much larger since it'll contain the entire web page including all images and other media. For this reason, asymmetric lines often provide a similar user experience for a typical home user, but at a lower cost. SDSL, as you might be able to guess, stands for Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line. SDSL technology is basically the same as ADSL except the upload and download speeds are the same. At one point, SDSL was mainly used by businesses that hosted servers that needed to send data to clients. As the general bandwidth available on the Internet has expanded and as the cost of operation have come down over the years, SDSL is now more common for both businesses and home users. Most SDSL technologies and have an upper cap of 1.544 megabits a second or the same as a T1 line. Further developments in SDSL technology have yielded things like HDSL or High Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines. These are DSL technologies that provision speeds above 1.544 megabits per second. There are lots of other minor variations in DSL technology out in the wild offering different bandwidth options and operating distances. These variations can be so numerous and minor, it's not really practical to try to cover them here. If you ever need to know more about a specific DSL line, you should contact the ISP that provides it for more details.



公共电话网络是让 人们连接到互联网的绝佳选择，因为公共电话网络已经到处都有基础设施。 很长一段时间 以来，拨号连接是人们从家里连接到互联网的主要方式。 但是，尝试将 数据传输作为基本上只是音频波存在某些限制。 由于人们希望更快速地接入互联网， 电话公司开始怀疑他们是否可以 使用相同的基础设施，但以不同的方式使用。 研究表明， 现代电话线路使用的双绞铜能够传输 更多的数据，而不是语音对语音通话所需的数据。 通过在不干扰正常电话呼叫的频率范围内工作， 一种称为数字用户线路或 DSL 的技术能够通 过线路传送比传统拨号技术更多的数据。 最重要的是，这允许 在同一线路上同时进行正常的语音电话呼叫和数据传输。 与 拨号使用调制解调器一样， DSL 技术也使用自己的调制解调器。 但更准确地说，它们被称为 DSLA M 或数字用户线路接入多路复用器。 就像拨号调制解调器一样， 这些设备通过电话线路建立数据连接， 但与拨号连接不同，它们通常是长时间运行的。 这意味着连接通常是在 DSLAM 打开 电源时建立的，并且在关闭 DSLAM 之前不会断开连接。 有很多不同类型的 DSL 可用， 但它们都以非常小的方式变化。 长期以来， 两种最常见的 DSL 类型是 ADSL 和 SDSL。 ADSL 代表非对称数字用户线路。 ADSL 连接具有不同的出站和传入数据的速度。 通常，这意味着下载速度更快，上传速度更慢。 家庭用户很少需要上传 他们下载的数据，因为家庭用户大多数只是客户端。 例如，当您在 Web 浏览器中打开网页时， 上载或出站数据非常小。 你只是要求从 Web 服务器提供一个特定的网页。 下载或入站数据往往要大得多，因为 它将包含整个网页，包括所有图像和其他媒体。 因此，非对称线路通常 为典型的家庭用户提供类似的用户体验， 但成本较低。 SDSL，正如您可以猜到的那样， 代表对称数字用户线。 SDSL 技术基本上与 ADSL 相同，只是上传和下载速度相同。 有 一次，SDSL 主要用于 托管需要向客户端发送数据的服务器的企业。 随着互联网上可用的一般带宽不断扩大，而 且随着运营成本的下降， SDSL 现在对企业和家庭用户来说更加普遍。 大多数 SDSL 技术，上限 为 1.544 兆位/秒，或与 T1 线相同。 SDSL 技术的进一步发展带来了诸如 HDSL 或高比特率数字用户线路之类的产品。 这些是 DSL 技术，可配置高于 1.544 兆位/秒的速度。 DSL 技术还有很多其他细微的变化， 提供了不同的带宽选项和工作距离。 这些变化可能 是如此众多和次要的，试图在这里覆盖它们并不实际。 如果您需要了解有关特定 DSL 线路的更多信息， 请联系提供该线路的 ISP 以获取更多详细信息。
