## Wireless Network Configurations

There are a few main ways that a wireless network can be configured. There are ad-hoc networks where nodes all speak directly to each other. There are wireless LANS or WLANS where one or more access points act as a bridge between a wireless and a wired network. And there are mesh networks which are kind of a hybrid of the two. Ad-hoc networks are the simplest of the three, in an ad-hoc network, there isn't really any supporting network infrastructure. Every device involved with the network communicates with every other device within range and all nodes help pass along messages. Even though they're the most simple, ad-hoc networks aren't the most common type of wireless network, but they do have some practical applications. Some smartphones can establish ad-hoc networks with other smartphones in the area so that people can exchange photos, video or contact information. You'll also sometimes see ad-hoc networks used in industrial or warehouse settings, where individual pieces of equipment might need to communicate with each other, but not with anything else. Finally, ad-hoc networks can be powerful tools during disaster situations. If a natural disaster like an earthquake or hurricane knocks out all of the existing infrastructure in an area, disaster relief professionals can use an ad-hoc network to communicate with each other while they perform search and rescue efforts. The most common type of wireless network you'll run into in the business world is a wireless LAN or WLAN. A wireless LAN consists of one or more access points, which act as bridges between the wireless and wired networks. The wired network operates as a normal LAN, like the types we've already discussed, the wired LAN contains the outbound internet link. In order to access resources outside of the WLAN, wireless devices would communicate with access points. They then forward traffic along to the gateway router, where everything proceeds like normal. Finally, we have what's known as mesh networks. Mesh networks are kind of like ad-hoc networks, since lots of the devices communicate with each other wirelessly, forming a mesh. If you were to draw lines for all the links between all the nodes, most mesh networks you'll run into are made up of only wireless access points and will still be connected to a wired network. This kind of network let's you deploy more access points to the mesh without having to run a cable to each of them. With this kind of setup, you can really increase the performance and range of a wireless network.



配置无线网络的主要方法有几种。 有点对点网络，其中节点都可以直接相互通话。 有无线 LAN 或 WLAN，其中一个或 多个接入点充当无线网络和有线网络之间的桥梁。 还有一些网状网络是两者的混合。 点 对点网络是三者中最简单的，在点对点网络中， 实际上没有任何支持的网络基础架构。 网络涉及的每个设备都与 范围内的其他设备进行通信，所有节点都有助于传递消息。 即使它们是最简单的，但对点网络并不是最常见的 无线网络类型，但它们确实有一些实用的应用。 一些智能手机可以与 该地区的其他智能手机建立点对点网络，以便人们可以交换照片、视频或联系信息。 您有时还会看到工业或仓库环境中使用的 ad-hoc 网络，其 中各个设备可能需要彼此通信，但 无法与其他任何设备进行通信。 最后，在灾害情况下，点对网络可以成为强大的工具。 如果地震或 飓风等自然灾害破坏了一个地区的所有现有基础设施， 救灾专业人员可以在 执行搜索和救援工作时使用特设网络相互通信。您 在商业世界中遇到的最常见的无线网络类型是无线 LAN 或 WLAN。 无线 LAN 由一个或多个接入点组成， 这些接入点充当无线网络和有线网络之间的桥梁。 有线网络作为普通 LAN 运行，就像我们已经 讨论过的类型一样，有线 LAN 包含出站互联网链路。 为了访问 WLAN 以外的资源， 无线设备将与接入点通信。 然后，它们将流量转发到网关路由器， 在那里一切都像正常一样进行。 最后，我们有了所谓的网状网络。 网状网络有点像点对点网络， 因为许多设备之间以无线方式进行通信，形成网状网络。 如果要为所有节点之间的所有链接绘制线条， 您将遇到的大多数网状网络仅由无线接入点组成，并且 仍将连接到有线网络。 通过 这种网络，您可以将更多接入点部署 到网格，而无需为每个接入点连接电缆。 通过 这种设置，您可以真正提高 无线网络的性能和范围。
