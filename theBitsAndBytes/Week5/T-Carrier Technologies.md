## T-Carrier Technologies

T-carrier technologies were first invented by AT&T in order to provision a system that allowed lots of phone calls to travel across a single cable. Every individual phone call was made over individual pairs of copper wire before Transmission System 1, the first T-carrier specification, called T1 for short. With the T1 specification, AT&T invented a way to carry up to 24 simultaneous phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper. Years later, this same technology was repurposed for data transfers. Each of the 24 phone channels was capable of transmitting data at 64 kilobits per second, making a single T1 line capable of transmitting data at 1.544 megabits per second. Over the years, the phrase T1 has come to mean any twisted pair copper connection capable of speeds of 1.544 megabits per second, even if it doesn't strictly follow the original Transmission System 1 specification. Originally, T1 technology was only used to connect different telecom company sites to each other and to connect these companies to other telecom companies. But with the rise of the Internet as a useful business tool in the 1990s, more and more businesses started to pay to have T1 lines installed at their offices to have faster Internet connectivity. More improvements to the T1 line were made by developing a way of multiple T1s to act as a single link. So a T3 line is 28 T1s, all multiplexed, achieving a total throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second. You'll still find T-carrier technologies in use today, but they've usually been surpassed by other broadband technologies. For small business offices, cable broadband or fiber connections are now way more common since they're much cheaper to operate. For inter-ISP communications, different fiber technologies have all replaced older copper-based ones.



T-Carrier 技术首先由 AT&T 发明，目的是提供 一个系统，允许大量的电话通过一条电缆传输。 每个单独的电话通话都是在 传输系统 1 之前通过单独的铜线进行的，这是第一个 T 载体规格，简称为 T1。 借助 T1 规范，AT&T 发明了一种方法，可通 过单块扭曲的铜缆同时进行多达 24 次电话。 几年后，这项技术被重新用于数据传输。 24 个电话通道中的每个通道都能够以 每秒 64 千比特的速度传输数 据，使单个 T1 线路能够以每秒 1.544 兆比特的速度传输数据。 多年来，短语 T1 已经意味着任何扭曲的铜 连接，速度可达 1.544 兆位/秒，即使它 不严格遵循原始传输系统 1 规范。最初，T1 技术仅用于将不同的电信公司 站点相互连接，并将这些公司与其他电信公司联系起来。 但随着互联网在 1990 年代成为一种有用的商业工具的兴起， 越来越多的企业开始付费在 办公室安装 T1 线路，以便更快地连接互联网。 通过开发一种将多个 T1 作为单一链路的方式，对 T1 线进行了更多的改进。 因此，一条 T3 线路是 28 T1，全部多路复用 ，实现每秒 44.736 兆位的总吞吐速度。您仍然会发现现在在使用 T 载波技术，但 它们通常被其他宽带技术所超越。 对于小型企业办公室来说，有线宽带或 光纤连接现在变得更加普遍，因为它们的运营便宜得多。 对于 ISP 之间的通信， 不同的光纤技术都取代了旧的铜基技术。
