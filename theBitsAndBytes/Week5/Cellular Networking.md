## Cellular Networking



Another super popular form of wireless networking is cellular networking, also called mobile networking. Cellular networks are now common all over the world. In some places, using a cellular network for Internet access is the most common way of connecting. At a high level, cellular networks have a lot in common with the 802.11 networks we've already talked about. Just like there are many different 802.11 specifications, there are lots of different cellular specifications. Just like Wi-Fi, cellular networking operates over radio waves, and there are specific frequency bands specifically reserved for cellular transmissions. One of the biggest differences is that these frequencies can travel over longer distances more easily, usually over many kilometers or miles. Cellular networks are built around the concept of cells. Each cell is assigned a specific frequency band for use. Neighboring cells are set up to use bands that don't overlap, just like how we discussed the optimal setup for a W Lan with multiple access points. In fact, the cell towers that broadcast and receive cellular transmissions can be thought of like access points, just with a much larger range. Lots of devices today use cellular networks for communication. And not just phones, also tablets and some laptops also have cellular antennas. It's become more and more common for high-end automobiles to have built-in cellular access, too. One module down, one final module to go.

另一种超级流行的无线网络形式是蜂窝网络， 也称为移动网络。 蜂窝网络现在在世界各地普遍存在。 在某些地方，使用蜂窝网络进行 互联网接入是最常见的连接方式。 在高层次上，蜂窝网络与 我们已经讨论过的 802.11 网络有很多共同点。 就像有许多不同的 802.11 规格一样， 有很多不同的蜂窝规格。 就像 Wi-Fi 一样，蜂窝网络通过无线电波运行，并且还 有专门为蜂窝传输保留的特定频段。 其中 最大的区别之一是，这些频率可以 更容易地在更长的距离上行驶，通常是在数公里或英里之内。蜂窝网络是围绕细胞的概念建立的。 每个单元都有一个特定的频段供使用。 相邻单元被设置为使用不重叠的波段，就像我们 讨论了具有多个接入点的 W Lan 的最佳设置一样。 事实上，广播和接收蜂窝传输的蜂窝塔可以被 认为像接入点一样，只是具有更大范围的接入点。 如今，许多设备都使用蜂窝网络进行通信。 不仅仅是手机，还有平板电脑和一些笔记本电脑也有蜂窝天线。 对于高端汽车而言，内置蜂窝接入也变得越来越普遍。 一个模块下来，最后一个模块要去。 一旦你完成了我们为你准备的评估，我会在那里见到你。
