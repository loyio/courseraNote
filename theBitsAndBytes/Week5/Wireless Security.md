## Wireless Security



When you're sending data over a wired link, your communication has a certain amount of inherent privacy. The only devices that really know what data is being transmitted are the two nodes on either end of the link. Someone or some device that happens to be in close proximity can't just read the data. With wireless networking, this isn't really the case, since there aren't cables, just radio transmissions being broadcast through the air, anyone within range could hypothetically intercept any transmissions, whether they were intended for them or not. To solve this problem, WEP was invented. WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy, and it's an encryption technology that provides a very low level of privacy. Actually, it's really right there in the name, wired equivalent privacy. Using WEP protects your data a little but it should really only be seen as being as safe as sending unencrypted data over a wired connection. The WEP standard is a really weak encryption algorithm. It doesn't take very long for a bad actor to be able to break through this encryption and read your data. You'll learn more about key lengths and encryption in a future course. But for now, it's important to know that the number of bits in an encryption key corresponds to how secure it is, the more bits in a key the longer it takes for someone to crack the encryption. WEP only uses 40 bits for its encryption keys and with the speed of modern computers, this can usually be cracked in just a few minutes. WEP was quickly replaced in most places with WPA or Wi-Fi Protected Access. WPA, by default, uses a 128-bit key, making it a whole lot more difficult to crack than WEP. Today, the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks is WPA2, an update to the original WPA. WPA2 uses a 256-bit key make it even harder to crack. Another common way to help secure wireless networks is through MAC filtering. With MAC filtering, you configure your access points to only allow for connections from a specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust. This doesn't do anything more to help encrypt wireless traffic being sent through the air, but it does provide an additional barrier preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to the wireless network itself.



当您通过有线链接发送数据时， 您的通信具有一定程度的固有隐私。 唯一真正知道正在 传输哪些数据的设备是链路两端的两个节点。 恰好靠近的某个人或某些设备不能仅仅读取数据。 对于 无线网络，情况并非如此， 因为没有电缆， 只是通过空中广播的无线电传输， 范围内的任何人都可以假设拦截任何传输， 无论它们是否为他们打算。 为了解决这个问题，发明了 WEP。 WEP 代表有线等效隐私 ，它是一种提供非常低级别隐私的加密技术。 事实上，它真的在那里的名字，有线等效的隐私。 使用 WEP 会稍微保护您的数据，但它应该 被视为与通过有线连接发送未加密数据一样安全。 WEP 标准是一种非常薄弱的加密算法。 坏角色不需要很长时间才 能突破这种加密并读取您的数据。 在 未来的课程中，您将了解有关密钥长度和加密的更多信息。 但 是现在，重要的是要知道加密密钥中的位数与它的安全程度相对应，密 钥中的位越多，有人破解加密所需的时间越长。 WEP 只使用 40 位作为其加密密钥，随着现代计算机的速度， 这通常可能在几分钟内破解。 WEP 在大多数地方被 WPA 或 Wi-Fi 保护接入迅速取代。 默认情况下，WPA 使用 128 位密钥， 这使得它比 WEP 更难以破解。 如今，无线网络最常用的加密算法是 WPA2，这 是对原始 WPA 的更新。 WPA2 使用 256 位密钥，使其更难以破解。 帮助保护无线网络安全的另一种常见方法是通过 MAC 过滤。 通过 MAC 筛选，您可以将 接入点配置为仅允许来自属于您信任设备的一组特定 MAC 地址的连接。 这无助于加密通过 空中发送的无线通信量， 但它确实提供了一个额外的屏障，防止 未经授权的设备连接到无线网络本身。
