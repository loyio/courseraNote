## Point-to-Point VPNs



A popular alternative to Whann technologies are point-to-point VPNs. Whann technologies are great for when you need to transport large amounts of data across lots of sites, because Whann technologies are built to be super fast. A business cable or DSL line might be way cheaper but it just can't handle the load required in some of these situations. But over the last few years, companies have been moving more and more of their internal services into the cloud. We'll cover exactly what this means later, but for now, it's enough to know that the cloud lets companies outsource all or part of their different pieces of infrastructure to other companies to manage. Let's take the concept of email. In the past, a company would have to run their own email server if they wanted an email presence at all. Today, you could just have a cloud hosting provider host your email server for you. You could even go a step further and using email as a service provider, then you wouldn't have an email server at all anymore. You just have to pay another company to handle everything about your email service. With these types of cloud solutions in place, lots of businesses no longer require extreme high speed connections between their sites. This makes the expense of a Whann technology totally unnecessary. Instead, companies can use point-to-point VPNs to make sure that there are different sites can still communicate with each other. A point-to-point VPN, also called a site-to-site VPN, establishes a VPN tunnel between two sites. This operates a lot like the way that a traditional VPN setup lets individual users act as if they are on the network they're connecting to. It's just that the VPN tunneling logic is handled by network devices at either side, so that users don't all have to establish their own connections. Now, it's time for one more quiz to see how your connections are firing.



Whann 技术的一个流行替代方案是点对点 VPN。 Whann 技术非常适合您需要 跨大量站点传输大量数据， 因为 Whann 技术的构建速度超快。 商用电缆或 DSL 线路 可能更便宜，但在某些情况下，它无法处理所需的负载。 但在过去几年中， 公司越来越多的内部服务迁移到云中。 我们稍后将详细介绍这意味着什么，但现在，只要知道云允许公司将其不同基础架构的全部或部分外包给其他公司管理就足够了。 让我们来看看电子邮件的概念。 在过去，如果公司 想要电子邮件状态，则必须运行自己的电子邮件服务器。 今天，您可以让一个云托管提供商为您托管您的电子邮件服务器。 你甚至可以更进一步，使用电子邮件作为服务提供商， 那么你就不再有电子邮件服务器了。 您只需要支付另一家公司来处理有关您的电子邮件服务的所有内容。 有了这些类型的云解决方案， 许多企业不再需要站点之间的极高速连接。 这使得 Whann 技术的费用完全不必要。 相反，公司可以使用点对点 VPN 来确保不同的站点仍然可以相互通信。 点对点 VPN（也称为站点到站点 VPN）在 两个站点之间建立 VPN 隧道。 这很像传统 VPN 设置 允许个人用户像他们在连接到的网络上一样行事。 只是 VPN 隧道逻辑由两侧的网络设备处理， 因此用户不必全部建立自己的连接。 现在，现在是时候再进行一次测验了解你们的连接是如何发射的。
