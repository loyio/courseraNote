## What is broadband?

The term broadband has a few definitions. In terms of internet connectivity, it's used to refer to any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up Internet. Broadband Internet is almost always much faster than even the fastest dial-up connections and refers to connections that are always on. This means that they're long lasting connections that don't need to be established with each use. They're essentially links that are always present. Broadband shaped today's world. While the Internet itself is a totally amazing invention, it wasn't until the advent of broadband technologies that its true potential for business and home users was realized. Long before people had broadband connections at home, businesses spent a lot of resources on them usually out of necessity. If you had an office with more than a few employees, the bandwidth available by a single dial-up connection would quickly be oversaturated by just a few users. By the mid 1990's, it had become pretty common for businesses that needed internet access for their employees to use various T-carrier technologies. T-carrier technologies were originally invented by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link. Eventually, they also became common transmission systems to transfer data much faster than any dial-up connection could handle. We'll cover the details of T-carrier technologies in an upcoming lesson. After businesses got into the broadband game, home use became more prevalent. As different aspects of the Internet, like the World Wide Web became more complex, they also required ever increasing data transfer rates. In the days of dial-up, even a single image on a web page could take many seconds to download and display. High resolution photos that you can now take on a cell phone would have required a long time to download and a lot of your patience. A single picture taken on a smartphone today can easily be several megabytes in size. Two megabytes would translate to 16,777,216 bits. At a baud rate of 14.4 kilobits per second, that many bits would take nearly 20 minutes to download. No one would've had time to download all the hilarious cat images on the internet back then. What a travesty. Without broadband internet connection technologies, the Internet as we know it today wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be able to stream music, or movies, or easily share photos. You definitely couldn't be taking an online course like this. T-carrier technologies require dedicated lines, which makes them more expensive. For this reason, you usually only see them in use by businesses. But other broadband solutions also exist for both businesses and consumers. In the next few videos, we'll deep dive into four of the most common broadband solutions available today: T-carrier technologies, digital subscriber lines or DSL, cable broadband, and fiber connections.

宽带这一术语有几个定义。 在互联网连接方面， 它是指任何不是拨号互联网的连接技术。 宽带互联网几乎总是比最快 的拨号连接快得多，指的是始终处于打开状态的连接。 这意味着它们是 长期的连接，不需要每次使用都建立起来。 它们本质上是始终存在的链接。 宽带塑造了当今世界。 虽然互联网本身是一个完全令人惊叹的发明， 但直到宽带技术的出现，它 对企业和家庭用户的真正潜力才得以实现。 早在人们在家里建立宽带连接之前， 企业在这些连接上花费了大量资源，通常是出于必要的。 如果您的办公室拥有超过几名员工，那么 单个拨号连接可用的带宽 很快就会被少数用户过度饱和。到 20 世纪 90 年代中期，对于需要互联网接入的企业来说，使用各种 T 载波技术已变得非常普遍。 T-Carrier 技术最初由 AT&T 发明，目的是通过单个链路传输多个电话。 最终，它们还成为常见的传输系统， 传输数据的速度远远超过任何拨号连接所能处理的速度。 我们将在接下来的课程中详细介绍 T 型载波技术。 在企业进入宽带游戏之后， 家庭使用变得更加普遍。 随着互联网的不同方面， 如万维网变得更加复杂， 它们也需要不断提高数据传输速率。 在拨号的日子里，即使是 网页上的单个图像也可能需要几秒钟的时间才能下载和显示。 您现在可以在手机上拍摄的高分辨率照片 将需要很长时间才能下载和大量的耐心。 今天在智能手机上拍摄的单张照片可以很容易地达到几兆字节的大小。 两兆字节将转换为 16,777,216 位。 以 每秒 14.4 千比特的波特率下， 许多位将需要近 20 分钟的时间才能下载。 没有人会有时间 在互联网上下载所有热闹的猫图像，那时。 真是一个嘲弄如果没有宽带互联网连接技术，我们今天所知的互联网就不可能存在。 我们将无法流式传输音乐 或电影，也无法轻松共享照片。 你绝对不能参加这样的在线课程。 T 型载波技术需要专用线路， 这使得它们更加昂贵。 出 于这个原因，您通常只能看到企业使用它们。 但其他宽带解决方案也适用于企业和消费者。 在接下来的几个视频中， 我们将深入探讨 当今最常见的四种宽带解决方案：T 型载波技术、 数字用户线路或 DSL、 有线宽带和光纤连接。 你准备好了吗 让我们开始吧
