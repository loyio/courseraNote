## Firewalls

You know what network device we haven't mentioned that you're probably super familiar with? A firewall. A firewall is just a device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria. Firewalls are a critical concept to keeping a network secure since they are the primary way you can stop traffic you don't want from entering a network. Firewalls can actually operate at lots of different layers of the network. There are firewalls that can perform inspection of application layer traffic, and firewalls that primarily deal with blocking ranges of IP addresses. The reason we cover firewalls here is that they're most commonly used at the transportation layer. Firewalls that operate at the transportation layer will generally have a configuration that enables them to block traffic to certain ports while allowing traffic to other ports. Let's imagine a simple small business network. The small business might have one server which hosts multiple network services. This server might have a web server that hosts the company's website, while also serving as the file server for a confidential internal document. A firewall placed at the perimeter of the network could be configured to allow anyone to send traffic to port 80 in order to view the web page. At the same time, it could block all access for external IPs to any other port. So that no one outside of the local area network could access the file server. Firewalls are sometimes independent network devices, but it's really better to think of them as a program that can run anywhere. For many companies and almost all home users, the functionality of a router and a firewall is performed by the same device. And firewalls can run on individual hosts instead of being a network device. All major modern operating systems have firewall functionality built-in. That way, blocking or allowing traffic to various ports and therefore to specific services can be performed at the host level as well. Up next, firing up your brain for a short quiz.





你知道我们没有提到你可能超 熟悉的网络设备吗？ 防火墙。 防火墙只是阻止满足特定条件的流量的设备。 防火墙是保持网络安全的一个关键概念，因为防火墙 是阻止您不希望进入网络的流量的主要方式。防火墙实际上可以在网络的许多不同层次上运行。 有防火墙可以检查应用层流量， 而防火墙则主要处理 IP 地址的阻塞范围。 我们在这里介绍防火墙的原因是它们最常用 于交通层。在传输层运行的防火墙通 常具有一种配置，使其能够阻止流 向特定端口的流量，同时允许流向其他端口。 让我们想象一个简单的小型企业网络。 小型企业可能有一台服务器托管多个网络服务。 此服务器可能有一个托管公司网站的 Web 服务器， 同时也作为机密内部文档的文件服务器。可以将置于网络外围的防火墙配置为允许 任何人向端口 80 发送流量以查看网页。 同时，它可以阻止外部 IP 对任何其他端口的所有访问。 因此，局域网外的任何人都不能访问文件服务器。防火墙有时是独立的网络设备，但 最好将它们视为可以在任何地方运行的程序。 对于许多公司和几乎所有家庭用户来说，路由器和 防火墙的功能由同一台设备执行。 而 且防火墙可以在单个主机上运行，而不是网络设备。 所有主要的现代操作系统都内置了防火墙功能。 这样，也可以 在主机级别执行阻止或允许通过各种端口进行流量以及特定服务的流量。 接下来，发射你的大脑进行一个简短的测验。
