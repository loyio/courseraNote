## The Application Layer and the OSI Model

In our opening module, we talked about how there are lots of competing network layer models. We've been working from a five-layer model, but you'll probably run into various other models during your career as an IT support specialist. Some models might combine the physical and data link layers into one and only talk about four layers. But you might remember a certain model we called out specifically in a reading section back in the first module. This is the OSI or Open Systems Interconnection model. This model is important to understand with our five-layer model because it's the most rigorously defined. That means it's often used in academic settings or by various network certification organizations. The OSI model has seven layers, and introduces two additional layers between our transport layer and our application layer. The fifth layer in the OSI model is the session layer. The concept of a session layer is that it's responsible for things like facilitating the communication between actual applications and the transport layer. It's the part of the operating system that takes the application layer data that's been unencapsulated from all the layers below it, and hands it off to the next layer in the OSI model, the presentation layer. The presentation layer is responsible for making sure that the unencapsulated application layer data is actually able to be understood by the application in question. This is the part of an operating system that might handle encryption or compression of data. While these are important concepts to keep in mind, you'll notice that there isn't any encapsulation going on. That's why in our model we lump all of these functions into the application layer. We believe a five-layer model is the most useful when it comes to the day-to-day business of understanding networking, but the seven-layer OSI model is also prevalent. No networking education would be complete without understanding its basics.



在我们的开放模块中， 我们讨论了如何存在很多竞争的网络层模型。 我们 一直从五层模型开始工作，但在您担任 IT 支持专家的职业生涯中，您可能会遇到各种其他模型。 某些模型可能会将物理层和 数据链路层合并为一个，但只谈论四个层。 但是你可能还记得我们在第一个模块的阅读 部分中专门调用的某个模型。 这是 OSI 或开放系统互连模型。 对 于我们的五层模型来说，这个模型非常重要，因为它是定 义最严格的模型。 这 意味着它经常用于学术环境或 各种网络认证组织。 OSI 模型有七层，并在我们的 传输层和我们的应用层之间引入了另外两层。 OSI 模型中的第五层是会话层。 会话层的概念是，它负责 促进实际应用程序和传 输层之间的通信。 它是操作系统的一部分，它将从其下面的所有层中取消封装的应用层数据，并将其交给 OSI 模型中的下一层，即表示层。 表示层负责 确保所 涉应用程序实际上能够理解未封装的应用层数据。 这是操作系统中可能处理 数据加密或压缩的一部分。虽然这些都是需要牢记的重要概念，但 您会注意到没有任何封装正在进行。 这就是为什么在我们的模型中，我们将所有这些函数整合 到应用层中。 我 们相信五层模型对于 了解网络的日常业务来说是最有用 的，但七层 OSI 模型也很普遍。 如果 不了解其基础知识，网络教育就不会完整。
