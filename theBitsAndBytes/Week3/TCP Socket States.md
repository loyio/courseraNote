## TCP Socket States

A socket is the instantiation of an endpoint in a potential TCP connection. An instantiation is the actual implementation of something defined elsewhere. TCP sockets require actual programs to instantiate them. You can contrast this with a port which is more of a virtual descriptive thing. In other words, you can send traffic to any port you want, but you're only going to get a response if a program has opened a socket on that port. TCP sockets can exist in lots of states. And being able to understand what those mean will help you troubleshoot network connectivity issues as an IT support specialist. We'll cover the most common ones here. LISTEN. Listen means that a TCP socket is ready and listening for incoming connections. You'd see this on the server side only. SYN_SENT. This means that a synchronization request has been sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet. You'd see this on the client side only. SYN_RECEIVED. This means that a socket previously in a listener state, has received a synchronization request and sent a SYN_ACK back. But it hasn't received the final ACK from the client yet. You'd see this on the server side only. ESTABLISHED. This means that the TCP connection is in working order, and both sides are free to send each other data. You'd see this state on both the client and server sides of the connection. This will be true of all the following socket states, too. So keep that in mind. FIN_WAIT. This means that a FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other end hasn't been received yet. CLOSE_WAIT. This means that the connection has been closed at the TCP layer, but that the application that opened the socket hasn't released its hold on the socket yet. CLOSED. This means that the connection has been fully terminated, and that no further communication is possible. There are other TCP socket states that exist. Additionally, socket states and their names, can vary from operating system to operating system. That's because they exist outside of the scope of the definition of TCP itself. TCP, as a protocol, is universal in how it's used since every device speaking to TCP protocol has to do this in the exact same way for communications to be successful. Choosing how to describe the states of a socket at the operating system level isn't quite as universal. When troubleshooting issues at the TCP layer, make sure you check out the exact socket state definitions for the systems you're working with.



套接字是潜在 TCP 连接中端点的实例化。 实 例化是其他地方定义的东西的实际实现。 TCP 套接字需要实际程序来实例化它们。 您可以将其与更多的是虚拟描述性的端口进行对比。 换句话说，您可以 将流量发送到您想要的任何端口，但只有在程序在该端口上打开套接字时才会得到响应。 TCP 套接字可以存在于许多状态。作为 IT 支持专家，能够了解这些意义将帮助您解决网络连接问题。 我们将在这里介绍最常见的。 听着。 侦听意味着 TCP 套接字已准备就绪并侦听传入连接。 你只会在服务器端看到这个。 同步发送。 这意味着已发送同步请求， 但尚未建立连接。 你只会在客户端看到这个。 已接收同步。 这意味着以前处于监听器状态的套接字 已收到同步请求并将 SYN_ACK 发回。 但它还没有从客户端收到最终的 ACK。 你只会在服务器端看到这个。 已建立。 这意味着 TCP 连接处于工作状态， 双方都可以自由发送对方数据。 您将在连接的客户端和服务器端看到此状态。 对于以下所有套接字状态，这 也是如此。 所以请记住这一点。 FIN_ 等待。 这意味着已发送 FIN， 但尚未收到来自另一端的相应 ACK。 关闭-等待。 这意味着连接已在 TCP 层关闭， 但打开 套接字的应用程序尚未释放对套接字的保留。 关闭。 这意味着连接已完全终止， 并且不可能进一步通信。 还有其他 TCP 套接字状态存在。 此外，套接字状态及其名称 可能因操作系统而异。 这是因为它们存在于 TCP 本身定义的范围之外。 TCP 作为一种协议， 它的使用方式是通用的，因为每个与 TCP 协议交流的设备都必须以完全相同的方式完成通信才能成功。 选择如何 在操作系统级别描述套接字的状态并不那么普遍。 排除 TCP 层的问题时， 请确保检查 正在使用的系统的确切套接字状态定义。
