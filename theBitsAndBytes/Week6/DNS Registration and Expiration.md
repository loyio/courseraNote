## DNS Registration and Expiration

Refresher time. Remember that DNS is a global system managed in a tiered hierarchy with I can at the top level. Domain names need to be globally unique for a global system like this to work. You can't just have anyone decide to use any domain name. It would be chaos. Enter the idea of a registrar, an organization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individuals. Originally there were only a few registrars. The most notable was a company named Network Solutions Inc. It was responsible for the registration of almost all domains that weren't country specific. As the popularity of the Internet grew, there was eventually enough market demand for competition in this space. Finally, the United States government and Network Solutions Inc came to an agreement to let other companies also sell domain names. Today, there are hundreds of companies like this all over the world. Registering a domain name for use is pretty simple. Basically, you create an account with the registrar, use their web UI to search for a domain name to determine if it's still available, then you agree upon a price to pay, and the length of your registration. Once you own the domain name, you can either have the registrar's name servers act as the authoritative name servers for the domain, or you can configure your own servers to be authoritative. Domain names can also be transferred by one party to another, and from one registrar to another. The way this usually works is that the recipient registrar will generate a unique string of characters to prove that you own the domain and that you're allowed to transfer it to someone else. You configure your DNS settings to contain this string in a specific record, usually a text record. Once this information has propagated, it can be confirmed that you both own the domain and approve its transfer. After that, ownership would move to the new owner or registrar. An important part of domain name registration is that these registrations only exist for a fixed amount of time. You typically pay to register domain names for a certain number of years. It's important to keep on top of when your domain names might expire, because once they do, they're up for grabs and anyone else could register them.



复习时间。 请记住，DNS 是一个在分层层次结构中管理的全局系统， 我可以在顶层进行管理。 域名需要全局唯一才能使这样的全局系统正常工作。 你不能让任何人决定使用任何域名。 这将是混乱。 输入注册商的想法，即负责将 个别域名分配给其他组织或个人的组织。 最初只有少数注册服务员。 最值得注意的是一家名为 “网络解决方案公司” 的公司， 它负责 注册几乎所有不特定国家的域名。 随着互联网日益普及， 这个领域的竞争最终有足够的市场需求。 最后，美国政府和网络解决方案公司达成协议， 让其他公司也出售域名。 今天，世界各地有数百家这样的公司。 注册域名以供使用非常简单。 基本上，您在注册商创建一个帐户，使用他们的 Web UI 搜索 域名以确定域名是否仍然可用， 然后您同意支付的价格以及您的注册时间。 拥有域名后，您可以让注册商的域名服务器 充当域的权威域名服务器，也 可以将自己的服务器配置为权威服务器。 域名也可以由一方转让给另一方，也可以 从一个注册商转移到另一个注册商。 这通常的工作方式是，收件人注册商会生成 一个唯一的字符串，以证明您拥有该域名并 允许您将其转移给其他人。 您可以将 DNS 设置配置为在特定记录（ 通常是文本记录）中包含此字符串。 一旦此信息传播，您 就可以确认您既拥有域名，也可以批准域名的转移。 之后，所有权将移交给新所有者或注册商。域名注册的一个重要部分是，这些注册 只存在一段固定的时间。 您通常需要支付一定数量的域名注册费。 保持域名可能过期的最新信息非常重要， 因为一旦域名过期，它们就会被抓取，其他任何人都可以注册它们。
