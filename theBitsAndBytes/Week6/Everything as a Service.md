## Everything as a Service

In our last video, we gave you a basic definition of what cloud computing is, but the term has really come to mean so much more than just hosting virtual machines. Another term that's been used more and more with the rise of cloud computing is X as a service. Here, the X can stand for lots of different things. The way we've described the cloud so far would probably best be defined as infrastructure as a service or IaaS. The idea behind infrastructure as a service is that you shouldn't have to worry about building your own network or your own servers. You just pay someone else to provide you with that service. Recently, we've seen the definition of the cloud expand well beyond infrastructure as a service. The most common of these are platform as a service, or PaaS, and software as a service, or SaaS. Platform as a service is a subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customers to run their services. This basically means that an execution engine is provided for whatever software someone wants to run. A web developer writing a new application doesn't really need an entire server complete with a complex file system, dedicated resources, and all these other things. It doesn't matter if this server is virtual or not. They really just need an environment that their web app can run in. That is what platform as a service provides. Software as a service takes this one step further. Infrastructure as a service abstracts away the physical infrastructure you need and platform as a service abstracts away the server instances you need. Software as a service is essentially a way of licensing the use of software to others while keeping that software centrally hosted and managed. Software as a service has become really popular for certain things. A great example is e-mail. Offerings like Gmail for Business from Google or Office 365 Outlook from Microsoft are really good examples of software as a service. Using one of those services means you're trusting Google or Microsoft to handle just about everything about your email service. Software as a service is a model that's gaining a ton of traction. Web browsers have become so feature packed that lots of things that required standalone software in the past can now run well inside of a browser. And if you can run something in a browser, it's a prime candidate for SaaS. Today, you can find everything from word processors to graphic design programs to human resource management solutions offered under a subscription based SaaS model. More and more, the point of a business' network is just to provide an internet connection to access different software or data in the cloud.



在我们的上一个视频中，我们为您提供了一个基本的云计算定义， 但这个术语实际上已经意味着远远不仅仅是托管虚拟机。 随着云计算的兴起越来越多地使用的另一个术语是 X 即服务。 在这里，X 可以代表许多不同的东西。 到目前为止，我们描述云的方式可能最好 定义为基础架构即服务或 IaaS。 基础架构即服务背后的想法是，您 不必担心构建自己的网络或自己的服务器。 你只需付钱给别人来提供这项服务 最近，我们看到 云的定义远远超出了基础架构即服务的范围。 其 中最常见的是平台即服务、 PaaS 和软件即服务或 SaaS。 平台即服务是 云计算的一个子集，其中为客户提供了一个平台来运行其服务。 这基本上意味着执行引擎 是为任何人想要运行的软件提供的。 编写新应用程序的 Web 开发人员并不 需要整个服务器，包括复杂的文件系统、 专用资源以及所有其他内容。 此服务器是否为虚拟服务器并不重要。 他们真的只需要一个 Web 应用程序可以在其中运行的环境。 这就是平台即服务提供的内容。 软件即服务使这一点更进一步。 基础架构即服务抽象出您 需要的物理基础架构，而平台即服务抽象出您需要的服务器实例。 软件即服务本质上是一种 将软件的使用许可给他人，同时保持集中托管和管理该软件的一种方式。 软件即服务在某些事情中已经变得非常受欢迎。 一个很好的例子是电子邮件。 如 Gmail 为企业从谷歌或 Microsoft Office 365 Outlook 等产品是软件即服务的真正很好的示例。 使用其中一项服务意味着您可以信任 Google 或 微软来处理与您的电子邮件服务有关的所有内容。 软件即服务是一种正在获得大量牵引力的模式。 Web 浏览器已经变得如此丰富的功能，以至于 过去需要独立软件的许多东西现在可以在浏览器内部运行良好。 如果您可以在浏览器中运行某些内容，那么 它就是 SaaS 的主要候选项。如今，您可以在基于订阅的 SaaS 模型下找到从文字处理器到图形设计程序到人力资源管理解决方案的所有内容。 企业网络的重点越来越多只是提供 互联网连接来访问云中的不同软件或数据。
