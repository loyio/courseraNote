### Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing



#### Duplex communication

The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable 



#### Simplex communication

This process is unidirectional 





### Network Ports and Patch Panels

`RJ45` Port

- Link LED: Cable properly connected to two devices that are both powered on
- Activity LED: Would flash when data actively transmitted across the cable
