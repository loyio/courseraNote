## The Basics of Networking Devices



### Cables

connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them



#### copper

The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables

#### Crosstalk

When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire





#### Fiber cables

Contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair





### Hubs and Switches

The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area network



#### Hub

A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once

#### Collision domain

A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time

If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other





#### Switch





### Routers

A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks 



Layer 3:  Network layers





#### Border Gateway Protocol

Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic;





### Servers and Clients
