### Physical layer

Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers



### Data Link layer

Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate



### Network layer

Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers

##### Internetwork

A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet



IP is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world



### Transport layer

Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data



TCP Transmission Control Protocol

UDP User Datagram Protocol



### Application layer





### Example

### OSI Networking Model

In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s important to note that other models exist. The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer, but is otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model. It’s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco’s many networking certifications. The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into three layers total.
